# Unassigned jobs

When job cannot be assigned, it goes to the list of unassigned jobs:

```json
{{#include ../../../../../examples/json-pragmatic/data/basics/unassigned.unreachable.solution.json:113:123}}
```

Each item in this list has job id, reason code and description.

An example of problem with unassigned jobs can be found [here](../../../examples/pragmatic/basics/unassigned.md).
