# Command Line Tool

As it was described in `getting started` section, `vrp-cli` is simplest way to solve arbitrary VRP problem. At the moment,
it is possible to specify problem in two formats:

- **scientific**: a text format widely used for benchmarking various a algorithms in scientific papers. It has two types:
    - **solomon**: see [Solomon benchmark](https://www.sintef.no/projectweb/top/vrptw/solomon-benchmark)
    - **lilim**: see [Li&Lim benchmark](https://www.sintef.no/projectweb/top/pdptw/li-lim-benchmark)

- **pragmatic**: a custom json format designed to solve real world VRP problems.
