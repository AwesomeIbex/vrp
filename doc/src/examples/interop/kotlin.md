# Kotlin

This is example how to call `solve` method from kotlin. You need to make sure that `vrp-pragmatic` library is available
in runtime, e.g. by copying it to `resources` directory.

```kotlin
{{#include ../../../../examples/jvm-interop/src/main/kotlin/vrp/example/kotlin/Application.kt}}
```

You can check the project repository for complete example.
