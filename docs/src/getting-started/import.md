# Import from custom format

In general, expressing an arbitrary VRP problem in one simple and universal format is a challenging task. `pragmatic`
format aims to do that and there are [concept](../concepts/pragmatic/index.md) and [example](../examples/pragmatic/index.md)
sections which describe it in great details.

However, it might take some time to get a huge problem with a lot of jobs and vehicles converted into it. A `csv import`
feature might help here.
