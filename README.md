# Design

Although performance is constantly in focus, a main idea behind design is extensibility: the project
aims to support a very wide range of VRP variations known as Rich VRP. This is achieved through
various extension points: custom constraints, objective functions, acceptance criteria, etc.
More details can be found in the [docs](https://github.com/reinterpretcat/vrp).
